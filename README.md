Project Core: Climbing Toolbox

A web-based auxiliary toolbox designed for climbers, developed with AI assistance and deployed on GitHub Pages. It aims to evolve into a comprehensive training management platform.

1. Initial Feature: Route Editor (HoldFocus Canvas)

The first module of this project, designed to simplify the process for climbers and gyms to create and share new routes:

Smart Mask Selection: Combines lasso paths and color difference algorithms to precisely highlight climbing holds.

2. Future Development: Cloud & Analytics

Cloud Socialization: Integration of Firebase for user accounts, supporting personal cloud-based route albums and one-click sharing.

Image Analysis Evolution:

Human Motion Tracking: Transitioning from static marking to video analysis to automatically track climbing trajectories.

3. Features in Queue

Hangboard Training Timer: Specifically designed for hangboard and bouldering sessions.

Supports WeiHeng C06 Bluetooth Crane Scale integration for automatic finger strength data logging.

Gear Database: A comprehensive database for climbing shoe specifications and performance comparisons.

Pose Estimation: Utilizing AI to analyze center of gravity shifts and movement precision for technical feedback.
